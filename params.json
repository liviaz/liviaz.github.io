The main goal of my PhD research was to improve success rates and clinical outcomes after _in vitro_ fertilization (IVF) through better prediction of embryo viability. \r\n\r\nToward this goal, I noninvasively gathered optical and biomechanical data about embryos at various stages of development and built a model to accurately identify those with high viability. I then used this model to understand what goes wrong at the molecular level when an embryo fails to develop successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\nThe projects are listed below. You can also view the code for each project on my GitHub profile @liviaz. \r\n\r\n1. [Predicting egg and embryo viability based on measurements of their optical and biomechanical properties](https://liviaz.github.io/EmbryoProject)\r\n\r\n2. [Identifying patterns of gene expression associated with high developmental potential](https://liviaz.github.io/RnaSeqAnalysis)\r\n\r\n3. [Assessing freezing-induced damage on embryos based on automated image analysis](https://liviaz.github.io/OCTImageProcessing)\r\n\r\n4. [Modeling embryo development as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)](https://liviaz.github.io/EmbryoCulturePOMDP)\r\n\r\n5.
