# Project: identifying genes important for embryo development

This project was a continuation of my [work on predicting embryo viability](../predicting-viability.html). I used the classfier which I developed to predict embryo viability, and looked at differences in gene expression between embryos predicted to be viable and those predicted to be nonviable. This study was able to yield insight into what can go wrong early in development to prevent an embryo from resulting in a successful pregnancy.

This material is drawn from [my recently published paper](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160224/ncomms10809/full/ncomms10809.html) and accompanying code can be found on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/liviaz/EmbryoProject/tree/master/RNA_seq_analysis).
