# Project: predicting embryo viability

In this post I will briefly introduce the clinical need (and the motivation behind this project). Then I will go into more detail about the approach I used to tackle the problem of predicting embryo viability and show some results. The material on this page is drawn from [my recently published paper](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160224/ncomms10809/full/ncomms10809.html) and also from my class project for CS 229 at Stanford (Machine Learning).
